# üìù Reflection

## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
- Kanban provides a visual overview of all tasks and their priorities, making it easier to choose the most important work first. 
- WIP limits ensure each team member focus on completing tasks before picking up new ones, which reduces the risk of burnout and missed deadlines.

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
- Update task statuses immediately when progress changes
- Break down larger backend tasks into smaller cards for better tracking
- Regularly review the board to ensure my work aligns with the team‚Äôs current priorities.

## Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
- Add more descriptive titles and acceptance criteria for my tasks so other team members can quickly understand what the tasks are about without needing extra clarification.

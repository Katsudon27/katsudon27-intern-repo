# What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- Focus Bear places emphasis on both productivity and well-being while tailoring their features for people with ADHD, combining distraction blocking with personalised support such as timers, breaks and routine building.
- Unlike Freedom and Cold Turkey which focus on distraction blocking, or Tiimo and Routinery which focus on building routines and habits, Focus Bear integrates and tailors multiple features into a single, accessible tool for people with ADHD.
- For example, during my first 45-minute Focus Session, the app not only blocked distractions but also prompted me with 1-minute stretch videos and short breathing exercises, something I didn’t experience in the competitors.

# If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

- I would choose Focus Bear over its competitors because it provides more flexibility as an all-in-one tool that can help support both my productivity and well-being needs.
- For example,  I appreciated being able to adjust Focus Session lengths on the fly and receiving gentle, supportive break reminders instead of abrupt interruptions, with videos that I can follow along to do simple stretches and deep breaths.
- I also used its “Work From Home” vs. “Office” mode toggle while working from a cafe, and the app adjusted its distraction-blocking rules accordingly—none of the other apps I tried had this level of contextual flexibility.
- The combination of thoughtful features like these makes me feel like it is more supportive and tailored to my needs compared to strict blockers or generic habit-building apps

# What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

- Apps like Tiimo and Routinery have a more polished and visually consistent user interface, with clear typography, cohesive colour schemes, and smooth animations. This level of refinement can make the overall user experience more pleasant and engaging.
- For example, when setting up a morning routine in Tiimo, the animations for transitioning between tasks felt smooth and visually pleasant, whereas Focus Bear’s transitions felt more functional but less aesthetically refined.

# Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

- Focus Bear’s UI could benefit from more polish and consistency. While testing on my laptop with an external monitor, I noticed layout issues whereby the Motivation page and Edit Habits page sometimes misaligned, and micro-break videos only displayed partially.
- Improving responsive design and unifying visual styles could make the app feel more intuitive and professional. Drawing from Tiimo and Routinery’s design language could help make Focus Bear not only functional but also delightful to use.

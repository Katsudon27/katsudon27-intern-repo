# What do you hope to learn from this internship?

- I hope to gain hands-on experience in backend development, particularly in building and maintaining APIs and working with databases. I am also interested in learning how to integrate backend systems with front-end applications in a real-world setting.

# What skills are you most excited to develop?

- I am most excited to develop skills for solving problems in terms of backend, such as diagnosing and fixing bugs and performance bottlenecks, I am also excited to learn how to write clean and maintainable code that other developers can easily work with. I also want to improve my adaptability when facing unfamiliar tools, frameworks or technical challenges.

# What do you think you can contribute to the team?

- In both my part-time role as a Junior Software Engineer and my university assignments, I collaborated with teammates to debug critical issues under tight deadlines. One example was when a bug caused our machine learning models in the backend to not output data in the required format to be displayed on the frontend, I worked closely with my other teammate to debug the issue while my other teammate worked on the documentations that were required as part of the submission to ensure that we can meet the set deadline. This experience was important as it taught me to stay calm under pressure and communicate clearly to collaborate in a team environment, which are qualities that I believe will help me contribute meaningfully to Focus Bear's team.

# What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?

- I tend to overthink before speaking up, which sometimes makes me shy to share my ideas or ask clarifying questions. During this internship, I hope I can practice to be more proactive in discussions, even if my ideas are not perfect, so I can learn faster and contribute more.

# What does success in this internship look like for you?

- Success for me would mean building and deploying backend features that can help to improve Focus Bear's product, such as system performance improvements or new functionalities. I would also like to leave the internship with a stronger technical foundation in terms of backend, a more confident person in a team environment and proof that my work had brought positive impacts to Focus Bear.

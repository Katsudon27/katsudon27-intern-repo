# Reflection

## Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
- The multiple cursor shortcuts like Alt + Click and Ctrl + D will be the most useful for my daily work, as they allow editing repetitive code faster. 
- Navigation shortcuts like Ctrl + P and Ctrl + Shift + O will also save time when jumping between files and symbols.

## How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?
- Keyboard shortcuts remove the need to constantly switch between keyboard and mouse, which speeds up common actions like navigation and code editing. 
- Over time, this reduces cognitive load and improves workflow efficiency, allowing me to focus more on problem-solving instead of interface interactions.

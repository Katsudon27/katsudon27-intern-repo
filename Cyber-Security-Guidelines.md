# üìù Reflection

## What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
- Current security measures that I follow:
    - I use a password manager for my accounts.
    - I have enabled 2FA on my important services.
    - I also keep my system updated and auto-lock enabled.
- Areas of improvements
    - Avoid delaying software updates.
    - Report any suspicious activity quickly

## How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
- Configure automatic locking on my devices to ensure I do not forget the behaviour.
- Schedule monthly reviews of account security settings.

## What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Rotate passwords periodically.
- Enable 2FA wherever missing.
- Avoid password reuse completely.

## What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
- Immediately change the affected account password.
- Report the incident to the security or IT team.
- Run a full antivirus/malware scan.
- Enable/verify 2FA.

## Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
- I will use my password manager to generate unique and random passwords for every new account and enable 2FA immediately after account creation.

# üìù Reflection

## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

- Yes, during my capstone project, one of my team members took the initiative to set up a shared Kanban board and kept all communication in a dedicated MS Teams group chat.
- Each team member showed up to all meetings, gave timely updates, respected deadlines and provided constructive feedback to other member's work.
- It was made effective through clear communication and mutual respect from everyone on the team.

## What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

- Use polite and concise language for both written and verbal communication.
- Ask clarifying questions when needed and avoid assumptions.
- Be mindful of tone and intent to avoid misinterpretation.

## How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

- Acknowledge and give credit to others' contributions publicly.
- Participate actively in discussions without dominating them.
- Share humour appropriately while respecting boundaries.

## How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

- Review the agenda and any relevant documents in advance.
- Write down talking points, questions, and updates beforehand.
- Arrive early or log in a few minutes ahead of time.

## What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

- Following up on pending tasks without waiting for reminders.
- Anticipating blockers and communicating them early.
- Make suggestions when I identify areas of improvements.
- Seek out information actively by doing independent research or asking my teammates.

### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

- I will start with a friendly follow-up message after 1‚Äì2 days if there‚Äôs no response.
- If urgent or blocking, I will escalate by tagging the person in the relevant task or sending a direct message.
- I will only escalate further to the CEO for critical issues such as breaches of professional conduct or urgent operational risks.

## What are some things you won't do?

- Wait around for instructions.
- Coming to meetings unprepared.
- Ignore feedback and action items.
- Not provide any updates on my tasks.

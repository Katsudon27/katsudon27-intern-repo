# üìù Reflection

## How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

- I can use clear, simple language avoiding jargon or ambiguous terms.
- I will communicate in a patient, respectful tone and provide information in smaller, digestible pieces rather than overwhelming with too much information at once.
- I will also be more explicit about expectations and timelines to help reduce anxiety or confusion for them.

## What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

- Overloading the user interface with too many options or distractions can overwhelm users with ADHD or Autism.
- Using inconsistent navigation or unexpected interactions that reduce predictability.
- Using complex or vague language in instructions and messages.

## What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

- I can contribute to ensure that the UI components in my work are more consistent and straightforward, ensuring all interactive elements have clear labels, predictable behaviour and visual feedback to accommodate the needs of vulnerable populations.

# üõ†Ô∏è Task

## Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)

- After reading a Reddit post where people with ADHD shared their experience with different productivity tools, I identified that people with ADHD can get easily overwhelmed by the amount of tasks that are assigned to them and having.
- Additionally, most of them struggle with focusing on the task that they are supposed to be working on. For example, some of them mentioned that they would get distracted by other tasks while working on their current task.
- In terms of tools, most of them have different preferences of specific tools and apps such as simple pen and paper, Excel sheets and to-do list apps. I noticed that they have a preference towards tools that are simple and easy to use, rather than tools with many functionalities.

## Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible

- I would recommend improving the user experience for the to-do list feature to be more accessible by adding simple-to-follow tutorials to show how users can use the feature effectively.

## Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning

- Hi there! Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like staying focused can be really tough for you sometimes and that is completely understandable. You might find it helpful to use the to-do list feature to break the tasks into smaller steps and using the app‚Äôs micro breaks to refresh your mind. Please let me know if there‚Äôs a specific part of the app that feels confusing or overwhelming, and I‚Äôll be happy to help walk you through it.

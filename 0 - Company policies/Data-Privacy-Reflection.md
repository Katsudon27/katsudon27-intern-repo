# üìù Reflection

## What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- I will use Bitwarden as my password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
- I will enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all my work and personal accounts, including GitHub and Google Workspace.
- When working remotely, I will connect through my NordVPN client to avoid risks on public Wi-Fi.

## How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
- Store sensitive files in company-approved cloud storage with appropriate encryption mechanisms such as OneDrive.
- Share data only through secure channels (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer tools).
- Shred physical documents and use secure delete tools for digital files when disposing of data.

## What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- Common mistakes:
    - Using weak or reused passwords
    - Sending sensitive data over unsecured channels.
    - Leaving devices unlocked while away
    - Not updating software on your devices
- How to avoid:
    - Use a password manager such as Bitwarden to generate strong and random passwords.
    - Only use company-approved encrypted platforms to send sensitive data.
    - Enable auto-lock and logging out when away.
    - Enable automatic updates to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Brief anecdote on when I failed to apply one of the practices
- In the past, I reused weak passwords across multiple accounts because it felt easier than managing unique ones. This created a serious risk of data leakage if just one account was compromised. 
- Since then, I‚Äôve shifted to using Bitwarden to generate and manage strong, unique passwords for all my accounts. Going forward, I will continue this habit and regularly audit my saved credentials.

# üõ†Ô∏è Task

## Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
- I will regularly review and update my access credentials, ensuring old accounts are closed, and MFA is enabled for all active accounts.

## Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
- I will always store and share sensitive information through encrypted, company-approved platforms to minimise the risk of data breaches.

    - Enables faster feedback and product iterations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
- Scrum 
    - Sprints with a specific time period and scope.
    - Has defined roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner and Development Team
    - Uses sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
    - Used for projects with clear deliverables that can be broken into sprint goals.
- Kanban
    - Continuous workflow with no fixed-length sprints
    - Focuses on visualising work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving flow.
    - Has no prescribed roles whereby it assumes a group of individuals working on tasks.
    - Works well for teams with ongoing, variable tasks or unpredictable priorities.

### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
- "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." This principle keeps me focused on delivering quick iterations instead of getting stuck in planning, which is especially useful in a fast-moving startup environment like Focus Bear.

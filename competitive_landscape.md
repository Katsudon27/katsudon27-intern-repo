# What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
- Focus Bear places emphasis on both productivity and well-being while tailoring their features for people with ADHD, combining distraction blocking with personalised support such as timers, breaks and routine building. Unlike Freedom and Cold Turkey which focus on distraction blocking, or Tiimo and Routinery which focus on building routines and habits, Focus Bear integrates and tailors multiple features into a single, accessible tool for people with ADHD. Its emphasis on neurodivergent-friendly features and user-centred design stands out.

# If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
- I would choose Focus Bear over its competitors because it provides more flexibility as an all-in-one tool that can help support both my productivity and well-being needs. The combination of thoughtful features such as customisable breaks, gentle prompts, videos to follow along for doing small exercises during break and option to choose between Work From Home mode or Office mode makes me feel like it is more supportive and tailored to my needs compared to strict blockers or generic habit-building apps. 

# What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
-  Apps like Tiimo and Routinery have a more polished and visually consistent user interface, with clear typography, cohesive colour schemes, and smooth animations. This level of refinement can make the overall user experience more pleasant and engaging. 


# Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
- Focus Bear could improve its user interface to feel more consistent and polished, for example by refining the layout, unifying visual styles, and ensuring that elements scale and display properly across different window sizes. A more cohesive and visually appealing interface could make the app feel more trustworthy, easier to navigate, and more engaging for long-term use.

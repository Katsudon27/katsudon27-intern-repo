# Reflection

## Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

- The multiple cursor shortcuts like Alt + Click and Ctrl + D will be the most useful for my daily work, as they allow editing repetitive code faster.
- Navigation shortcuts like Ctrl + P and Ctrl + Shift + O will also save time when jumping between files and symbols.

## How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

- Keyboard shortcuts remove the need to constantly switch between keyboard and mouse, which speeds up common actions like navigation and code editing.
- Over time, this reduces cognitive load and improves workflow efficiency, allowing me to focus more on problem-solving instead of interface interactions.
- For example, while working on a small Python project, I had a function name repeated multiple times across the same file. Using Ctrl + D, I was able to quickly select each occurrence and rename them consistently without manually searching. This saved me several minutes compared to using the mouse and search function.

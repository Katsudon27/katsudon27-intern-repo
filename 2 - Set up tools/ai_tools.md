# Reflection

## Which AI tools did you try?

- I used GitHub Copilot (VS Code Extension) and ChatGPT (Web App).

## What worked well? What didnâ€™t?

- What worked well:
  - Provided clear explanations of concepts that I was unfamiliar with.
    - For example, in my capstone project, I had to explore data integration using the MQTT protocol and Azure IoT Hub which were technologies I had no prior experience with. By querying ChatGPT, I gained an understanding of what they are and how I could implement them in my project.
  - Generated boilerplate code for starting points.
    - I used GitHub Copilot to generate snippets for visualising the trend of mobile phone offences from 2010 to 2023 in one of my projects. This saved time and gave me a framework to build upon.
- What didn't work well:
  - AI responses were sometimes too general, so I had to refine my prompts to get more accurate results.
  - Code generated by GitHub Copilot often needed adjustments. For instance, the chart elements in my visualisation were initially misaligned so I had to manually adjust the code.

## When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

- When I need to understand new concepts.
- For repetitive coding tasks or generating boilerplate.
- When debugging simple errors, since AI can often point me in the right direction faster than searching documentations manually.

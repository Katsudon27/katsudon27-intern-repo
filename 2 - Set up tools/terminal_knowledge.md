# Reflection

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
- I chose Windows Terminal with Powershell because:
    - It comes pre-installed on my local machine.
    - It supports multiple tabs and panes.
    - It has a clean interface and easy customisation options.

## What customizations (if any) did you make?
- I changed the color scheme to a dark theme for better readability.
- I enabled a feature to automatically copy selection to clipboard.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?
- The most useful command I learned was "grep "keyword" filename".
- It allows me to search for a specific word or phrase inside a file without opening it, which will be useful when I am going through logs or code files.

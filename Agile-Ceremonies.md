# 🛠️ Task

## Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.
- I had attended a stand-up meeting where I shared the specific onboarding tasks that I have completed and are aiming to complete within the next week. 
- I also learned and listened about the tasks and the changes from other developers on the backend team.

## Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.
- I had reviewed past notes from a previous retrospective that was conducted in May 2025.

## Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
- I will provided clearer updates with summaries of what was done and any outstanding tasks, so my teammates can understand my current status without needing to ask further questions.

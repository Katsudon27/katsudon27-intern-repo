# üìù Reflection

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
- Agile ceremonies provide regular checkpoints to ensure the team is working towards the same goals. 
- They make progress visible, help identify blockers early, and give everyone a chance to raise issues or share feedback. 
- This reduces miscommunication and keeps priorities clear.

## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
- I think daily stand-ups are the most important because they allow me to share my progress quickly with the team and raise any issues or blockers that I am currently facing so I can resolve them and move on to the next task.

## Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
- I will provided clearer updates with summaries of what was done and any outstanding tasks, so my teammates can understand my current status without needing further clarifications.

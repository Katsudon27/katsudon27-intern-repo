# üìù Reflection

## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
- Agile ceremonies provide regular checkpoints to ensure the team is working towards the same goals. 
- They make progress visible, help identify blockers early, and give everyone a chance to raise issues or share feedback. 
- This reduces miscommunication and keeps priorities clear.

## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
- I think daily stand-ups are the most important because they allow me to share my progress quickly with the team and raise any issues or blockers that I am currently facing so I can resolve them and move on to the next task.

## Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.
- I attended the daily stand-up meeting on 6/8/2025 from 4pm to 4.15pm. 
- It was held on Google Meet with members of the Backend Team who were working on that day along with Jeremy (CEO of Focus Bear).
- The meeting was structured with Jeremy being the main facilitator and each developer takes turn to provide updates on their tasks.
- During the meeting, I updated Jeremy and the team on my current progress of completing the onboarding tasks and listened to updates from other developers on their tasks. 

## Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.
- I managed to review past notes and board for a retrospective held by the backend team on 6/5/2025.
- Some of the insights and items discussed:
    - The team needed more info on the dependencies on the backend.
    - The team underestimated work load for some of the tasks.
    - The team managed to perform testing cases for some of the new features that they were working on such as integration of ChatGPT 4.1-mini.

## Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
- I will provided clearer updates with summaries of what was done and any outstanding tasks, so my teammates can understand my current status without needing further clarifications.

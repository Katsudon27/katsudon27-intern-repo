# üìù Reflection

## When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
- When to use AI for assistance
    - Code generation for quick and simple tasks.
    - To brainstorm multiple approaches to solve a backend problem.
    - To summarise or explain unfamiliar concepts.
- When to rely on my own skills
    - When implementing security-sensitive features.
    - For making architecture decisions.
    - When debugging production issues tied to the company's infrastructure.

## How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
- Always review, test, and adapt outputs to project requirements.
- Continue improving problem-solving skills by attempting solutions before asking AI.

## What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
- Never share proprietary code, client data, or confidential information with AI tools.
- Use only approved and secure AI platforms.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

## Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
- I used GitHub Copilot to generate a D3.js line chart showing monthly mobile phone offence trends for one of my assignments. 

## Review the AI-generated output critically‚Äîdid it require editing or fact-checking?
- Copilot provided a functional starting point, but chart elements (axes, labels) were misaligned and the coding style did not match my project conventions.
- I adjusted element positions, renamed variables for clarity and consistency, and added error handling to match my project‚Äôs standards.

## Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
- I will always review AI-generated code to ensure that it is secure, accurate and complies with the coding standards before making any commits to the repository.

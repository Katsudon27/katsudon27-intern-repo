# Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
- Focus Bear was created to be a holistic productivity solution that is catered for neurodivergent individuals through features such as distraction blocking and habit guidance. 

# What problem is Focus Bear solving?
- Focus bear is trying to tackle the problem of existing solutions such as productivity apps and therapy programs not being financially accessible and suited for neurodivergent individuals. 

# Why do you think this mission is important?
- This mission is important as ADHD is a serious issue that is affecting communities around the world, causing negative impacts on people's lives such as reduced productivity and difficulty in studying. More importantly, in this world where we have increasing number of distractions from technologies that surround us and crave for our attention, I think this mission is not only important for people with ADHD but for anyone who is looking to form healthy habits and focus better, ultimately living a better and more meaningful life. 

# How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?
- Focus Bear's work aligns with my personal interest to build digital solutions that can help people to solve problems in their daily lives and ultimately lead to their better wellbeing. For example, Focus Bear's distraction blocking feature can help its users to stay focused and direct them back to the task that they are supposed to complete by blocking their access to distracting websites and applications like Facebook and YouTube. The fact that Focus Bear developed features like this based on research studies proved to me that Focus Bear is really trying to help its user to achieve better producitivty in an effective way. 

# Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
- Yes, I am aware of the challenge whereby there are increasing distractions from the services that we use everyday such as social media and entertainment sites that try to keep us on their platform for as long as possible. For example, I used to sit at my desk with the objective to complete my tasks but I would end up getting distracted by either scrolling on my phone or watch YouTube on my laptop, with zero progress on my tasks. This had caused me so much time, energy and guilt but I could not break out of the loop, so I really wished that I had an app like Focus Bear to help with this issue.

## What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- Always use strong, unique passwords and a reputable password manager.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all work accounts.
- Access sensitive data only on secure, encrypted networks (avoid public Wi-Fi unless using a VPN).

## How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
- Store sensitive files in encrypted storage (e.g., company-approved cloud storage with appropriate encryption mechanisms)
- Share data only through secure channels (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer tools).
- Shred physical documents and use secure delete tools for digital files when disposing of data.

## What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- Common mistakes:
    - Using weak or reused passwords
    - Sending sensitive data over unsecured channels.
    - Leaving devices unlocked while away
    - Not updating software on your devices
- How to avoid:
    - Use a password manager to generate strong and random passwords.
    - Only use company-approved encrypted platforms to send sensitive data.
    - Enable auto-lock and logging out when away.
    - Enable automatic updates to patch security vulnerabilities.

# üõ†Ô∏è Task

## Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
- I will regularly review and update my access credentials, ensuring old accounts are closed, and MFA is enabled for all active accounts.

## Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
- I will always store and share sensitive information through encrypted, company-approved platforms to minimise the risk of data breaches.

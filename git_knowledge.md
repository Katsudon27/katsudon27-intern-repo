# âœ… Tasks

## Install Git command line tools and verify installation (git --version).
- I have installed Git CLI on my local machine and verified the installation via git --version. 
- I currently have version 2.50.1 installed on my local machine.

## Decide if you want to use a Git client (e.g., GitHub Desktop, Git in VS Code) and set it up if needed.
- I have set up Git in VS Code as my Git client.

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
- Yes, I have used Git before in my capstone project.
- In the project, I used Git to collaborate with my teammates to develop our system by pulling code from the main repository.
- I also used separate branches to develop features or work on tasks in isolation.
- We merged branches after review to avoid breaking the main codebase. 

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
- I chose Git in VS Code because it integrates directly with my editor, making it easier to perform Git actions like push and commit without switching to another app or terminal.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
- Git stores data as snapshots of the entire project, not just line-by-line changes.
- This approach makes Git more efficient than older version control systems by allowing users to switch branches almost instantly based on different screenshots or restore entire project from any commit.
